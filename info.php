                <h3>So, what is this?</h3>
                <p><strong>Cloudberry</strong> is an off the grid, solar powered, long term photography project. Using a GoPro, a Raspberry Pi and a USB hotspot, the system we designed takes one photograph per hour between 8am and 8pm each day and automatically uploads the images via a LTE network to this website.</p>

                <p>The photographs depict a view of Pinchard’s Island from a small, family owned cabin named “Precious Moments.” Pinchard's Island, only accessible by boat for a few weeks of the year, is home to a few cabins that resettled residents use while picking bake apples (the local term for cloudberries) during the summer months.</p>

                <p>The view is static–in the sense that camera is always capturing the same frame; however, the lighting of the frame can vary drastically from one image to another. I see these photographs as a continuation of the moments I spent in the cabin glancing out the window at the surrounding landscape. I am interested in the visual transition of time and light. I am curious about the notion of watching and accessing a place without physically being present.</p>

                <h3>Okay, but why Pinchard's Island?</h3>

                <p>I have been photographing <a href="http://adamsim.ms/pinchards-island/" target="_blank">Pinchard’s Island</a> and it’s previous residents for several years, but the harsh conditions and the extreme remoteness of this island made it impossible to take images over longer periods of time during different seasons.  Cloudberry grew from the desire to be able to photograph the island throughout the year.</p>

                <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/50e5fc10e4b0291e3b9b75c6/588f654e725e2506f4c22cd9/588f68e56a4963c410121736/1485793514975/10_adam_simms_sisters.jpg" class="img-responsive info_img" alt="Pinchard's Island Sisters" />

                <p>Shortly after Newfoundland joined Canada as it’s 10th province, Pinchard’s Island was resettled in an attempt to modernize the province. I have been documenting the return of my grandmother, along with her brothers and sisters, to this island each summer in an attempt to rewrite the history of resettlement by reviving old ways of life and create new traditions.</p>

                <h3>Where is Pinchard's Island?</h3>

                <p>Pinchard's Island is situated at the northern edge of Bonavista Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. It was one of the first settled sites in Bonavista Bay but is no longer inhabited.</p>

                <h3>How?</h3>

                <p>Angela and I met early May 2017 to briefly discuss the possibility of collaborating together on a project. The idea was loose, but the goal was to take photos of the island remotely, upload the images via the cellular network and access them from anywhere. We both shared connections to Newfoundland and a passion for art and technology so we set out to see what was possible.</p>

                <p>Our initial research showed that there were a lot of possibilities as to how we could approach the project, but it was clear from the beginning that every decision would result of many constraints that would affect every decision–one after another. Power, temperature, weather, sunlight, data limits, storage, remoteness, were all components that constantly determined the decisions we made and the methods in which we worked.<p>

                <p>We used <a href="http://www.trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> to plan every aspect of the project, communicate, and document ongoing research:<p>

              <div class = "col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">

                <p>Designing a system that worked was only the start of the project. Every slight adjustment that we made to the system, such as moving from electricity to solar power, putting the USB hotspot in a case or using different USB cables introduced new problems that we had to constantly monitor and solve. Once we felt confident in our system, we had to be realistic that once the system was installed on the island, we would not be able to physically be there to troubleshoot any problem that might arise. This forced us to evaulate the entire solution and implement different components to help reduce the risk factor of the project.</p>

                <img src="img/info/notebook.jpg" class="img-responsive info_img" alt="Notebook" />

                <p>The entire system took us approximately 3 months to build. This includes the initial idea, research, system design, installation, and final production code. Below you’ll find a system map and an outline of all the hardware and software used to create Cloudberry.</p>

                <h4><strong>GoPro HERO4 Black with 16gb micro SD Card.</strong></h4>
                <p>We initially wanted to use the GoPro HERO5, but Cam Do enclosure did not support the GoPro HERO5. Creating a DIY weatherproof enclosure didn’t add any benefit since the image quality between GoPro HERO4 and GoPro HERO5 is the same; therefore, the decision was made to go with the GoPro HERO4.</li>

                <h4><strong>Cam Do Blink Interval Timer</strong></h4>
                <p>The interval timer turns on the GoPro HERO4 every hour between 8 AM and 8 PM. The GoPro runs an `autoexe` script upon power on that commands the camera to take a photo, turn on the GoPro WiFi and then puts the camera in standby mode to conserve power. In the event that something goes wrong, such as no power for a period of time, the interval timer will attempt turn on the camera everyday when there is power and enable WiFi so that we can control the camera remotely via the Raspberry Pi.</li>

                <h4><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</strong></h4>
                <p>Standard Raspberry Pi with a Noobs SD Card running Raspbian OS.</li>

                <h4><strong>WittyPi</strong></h4>
                <p>A real time clock (RTC) that turns on the Raspberry Pi night for 30 minutes. The Raspberry Pi runs a Python script that:
                		1. Wakes up the GoPro via WiFi.
                		2. Downloads and deletes the latest images from the GoPro.
                		3. Uploads the images to an Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket and deletes the images from the Raspberry Pi.
                		4. Puts the GoPro into standby mode.
                		5. Shuts down the Raspberry Pi to conserve power.</li>

                <h4><strong>Arduino Pro Mini + High Side DC Current Sensor Breakout Board</strong></h4>
                <p>We added a voltage meter to monitor the current power supply to avoid power issues that might corrupt the SD Card. In the event that the power supply is low, the Ardunio triggers the WittPi to shut down the Raspberry Pi until there is sufficient battery to power the device.</li>

                <h4><strong>WatchDog</strong></h4>
                <p>Since the Raspberry Pi is managed remotely the WatchDog monitors the health of the Raspberry Pi and automatically restarts the system in the event of a malfunction. </li>

                <h4><strong>HAUWEI LTE E8372 USB Hotspot</strong></h4>
                <p>A USB hotspot connected to the Raspberry Pi USB port with a SIM card and mobile internet plan from Bell Canada. This allows us to connect to the internet via USB and reserve the Raspberry Pi to connect to the GoPro HERO4 via WiFi. At ±6mb per photo, 13 photos per day, we’re using ±2.3gb per month.</li>

                <h4><strong>USB cables, extensions, and repeators</strong></h4>
                <p>All cables were weatherproof with plastic tubbing and electrical tape.</p>

                <h4><strong>Cam Do Weatherproof Enclosure</strong></h4>
                <p>Home of the GoPro HERO4. We made several modifications to the enclosure:
                <ul>
                  <li>The case has an opening on the top, which seemed problematic considering the harsh environment. We deduced to silicone the entire top opening to avoid potential leaking.</li>
                  <li>We drilled a whole in the bottom of the case to connect a USB cord and a repeater to power the GoPro. We then siliconed the USB cable and the entire opening of the hole to prevent potential leaking.</li>
                  <li>The enclosure comes with a standard screw on clear camera filter attached to the opening for the GoPro lens. We siliconed the entire edge of the filter to prevent potential leaking.</li>
                  <li>The first few days we were getting condensation on the filter preventing visibility to the GoPro lens. We decided to remove the air pressure filter of the Cam Do case in an attempt to allow more air flow. Since this modification the filter did not accumulate any further condensation. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4><strong>Nanunk Case</strong></h4>
                <p>Holds and insulates the Raspberry Pi with add-ons and the USB hotspot.

                <h4><strong>130 Watt Solar Power System</strong></h4>
                <p>We worked with Newfound Energies, Inc. in St. John’s Newfoundland to help design a solar panel system that would intermittently power the system we were designing. Because Pinchard’s Island receives approximately 1-1.5 hours of sunlight during the winter, we decided to go with a larger solar power system in hopes that it would be enough to power the system during the winter, allow for the charging of other devices (laptops, phones, etc) during the summer, and an investment in system that could be used for future projects.

                <ul>
                  <li>130-watt solar panel pointed at ±20 degrees towards the path of the sun during the winter. Adjusted to ±60 degrees in the summer.</li>
                  <li>40 amp solar charge controller</li>
                  <li>1500-watt inverter</li>
                  <li>Four 6 volt, 385 amp hour deep cycle batteries</li>
                  <li>30 amp automatic transfer switch</li>
                  <li>30 amp battery charger</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><strong>DIY Weatherproof Box</strong></h4>
                <p>We built an insulated, weatherproof housing unit for the solar power system.</p>

                <h4><strong>Dataplicity</strong></h4>
                <p>Allows us to connect to the Raspberry Pi remotely via the command line interface.</p>

                <h4><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></h4>
                <p>S3 Bucket for the storing the photographs, CloudFront for delivering the content.</p>

                <h4><strong>KonradIT's GoPro HERO4 WiFi Hacks</strong></h4>

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>During the second week of August, we embarked on our journey to install Cloudberry. The first task was to bring all of the solar power components to the island, which was a task that required four people to load the housing unit, batteries, and solar panel. It took approximately two days for Roger and I to install the entire system with constant readjustments. We had to balance cable lengths, accessibility, architecture of the cabin, and predict the potential weather problems. Based on our research of solar irradiance for the geocordinates of the cabin, we decided to tilt the solar panel at an angle of 20 degrees since the summer was coming to an end and the winter months would prove to be the most challenging for sunlight. We had to position the solar panel with the architecture of the roof and slightly over the heave to prevent the build up of ice and snow, but this was risky since it was difficult to tightly secure the panel to the roof in the event of high winds and slightly positions the panel out of the sun’s path.</p>

                <img src="img/info/solar-install.jpg" class="img-responsive info_img" alt="Solar Power Install" />

                <p>The second step was to choose the frame of the photograph and install the Cam Do enclosure. Prior to arriving at the island I was confused about what would be the best thing to capture; the landscape, the ocean, something else entirely. I was reliant on the outside structure of the cabin to orient the frame and through a process of elimination I was able to make a decision. Pointing the camera towards the south was directly inline with the path of the sun causing the image to be blasted throughout the day. The east and the west also was affected by the same blasting in the morning or the evening and only offered views of the landscape. Pointing the camera towards the north avoids the blasting issue and offers the view of both the landscape and the ocean, which seems to offer more diverse photographs. This frame also felt right since the placement of the camera is near the north facing window and reminds me of the inside view from the cabin window.</p>

                <img src="img/info/cam-do.jpg" class="img-responsive info_img" alt="Cam Do Enclosure" />

                <p>Next, it was time to assemble the camera components together and test. We connected the Cam Do interval timer to the GoPro HERO4, and powered camera via USB cables plugged into the solar power. The new USB cords we introduced were causing the camera to detect a USB power mode when the camera was turning on, which conflicted with the `autoexe` script that we wrote to take the photo, turn on WiFi and put the camera in standby mode. After half a day of troubleshooting, we had to rewrite the script to re-sequence the code to control the camera and go through a series of tests that component.</p>

                <p>Once we stabilized the camera component, we introduced the Raspberry Pi and it’s add-ons. Initial test had this component of the system performing well; the WittyPi was booting and shutting down the Raspberry Pi on schedule, the Raspberry Pi was connecting to the GoPro HERO4 WiFi enabling us to access the camera and the USB hotspot was providing internet to upload the images to the AWS S3 Bucket. However, once we settled the Raspberry Pi and it’s add-ons in the Nanuk case, it significantly impacted the WiFi signal to the point where we were not able to maintain a decent connection to the GoPro HERO4. This resulted in us completely rewiring the power to this component of the system to allow the Raspberry Pi be positioned as close to the camera as possible to improve the WiFi signal strength.</p>

                <img src="img/info/pi.jpg" class="img-responsive info_img" alt="Cloudberry" />

                <p>Once the entire system was in place, we monitored everything for an entire day before locking up all of the cases and leaving the island. It took us an entire week to put the system in place.</p>
